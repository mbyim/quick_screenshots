# quick_screenshots
Shell script to mimic the functionality of ctrl+cmd+shift+4 on macos: selects a region to grab, screenshots it, copies it to clipboard, and saves into my screenshots folder.

1) Clone Repo
2) Create dir for screenshots to be saved and edit script to match
3) Place screenshot.sh into /usr/local/bin
4) Bind ctl+cmd+shift+4 (or hotkey of choice) to screenshot.sh in Keyboard settings in Ubuntu.
